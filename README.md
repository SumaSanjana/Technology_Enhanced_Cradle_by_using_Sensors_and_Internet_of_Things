# Technology Enhanced Cradle Using Sensors and IoT

## Abstract
Conventional cradles lack the ability to monitor and support infants continuously or adapt to varying needs. This study proposes a novel smart cradle equipped with advanced sensors and actuators, enabling parents to control environmental factors in real time, ensuring the highest levels of safety and comfort for infants. Unlike previous models, the smart cradle automatically responds to stimuli, such as an infant’s cry, and allows for remote monitoring via the Blynk app. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed smart cradle offers faster response times and greater accuracy in environmental control compared to recent models, establishing it as a new benchmark in infant care products. This innovation addresses the deficiencies of current cradle designs and represents a significant advancement in automated infant care systems, ultimately conserving caregivers’ resources and improving overall infant care.
